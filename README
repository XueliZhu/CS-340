#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I achieve maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs by paying attention to writing clear, concise code, using meaningful variable and function names, consistent formatting, and thorough documentation. In Project One's CRUD Python module, I applied these principles in structuring the code into Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions. This modularity made it easier for me to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. The advantage of this approach is that the code will be readable, easy to modify, and extend for future projects. The CRUD module could be reused in the future for any new dashboard or data management system by simply plugging it into new contexts.


#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The way I, as a computer scientist, do problem-solving is by understanding the requirements, breaking down the problem into manageable pieces, and designing an efficient solution. In the Grazioso Salvare project, I carefully analyzed their database and dashboard requirements to ensure the system was robust and scalable. This approach differed from previous assignments because I focused more on user needs and business logic, incorporating best practices for database design and integration. In the future, I would employ such techniques as normalization in database design, query optimization, and maybe cloud-based solutions for similar client needs.


#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design systems, algorithms, and technologies that solve real-world problems. This enables enterprises to operate efficiently and innovate. In this case, in Grazioso Salvare, my work in the database and dashboard system will facilitate the management and visualization of data for better decision-making and operational efficiency. Having designed a system that would be scalable, maintainable, and meet their needs, I would have helped the company grow in the long run.
